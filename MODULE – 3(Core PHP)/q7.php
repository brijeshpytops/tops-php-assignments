<!-- What will be the values of $a and $b after the code below is executed?
Explain your answer.
$a = '1';
$b = &$a;
$b = "2$b"; -->

The values of $a and $b will both be "21".

Explanation:

- Initially, $a is assigned the string value '1'.

- Then, $b is assigned as a reference to $a, meaning $b refers to the same memory location as $a. So, $b also holds the value '1'.

- Next, the value of $b is updated to "2$b". This means "2" is concatenated with the value of $b, which is still "1" at this point. So, $b becomes "21".

- Since $b is a reference to $a, any change made to $b will also affect $a. Therefore, the value of $a will also be updated to "21".
