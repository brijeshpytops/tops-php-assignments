<!-- What Is Object Oriented Programming? -->
<!-- 
object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes. In OOP, programs are designed by creating classes that represent real-world entities or concepts, and objects are created based on these classes to interact with one another. OOP emphasizes concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to certain parts of the object to ensure data integrity and security.

Inheritance: The ability of a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (superclass or base class), allowing for code reuse and creating a hierarchy of classes.

Polymorphism: The ability of objects to take on different forms or behave differently based on the context. It allows methods to be called on objects of different classes, and the behavior of the method depends on the type of object it is called on. -->
