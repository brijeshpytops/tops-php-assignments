<!-- What Is Difference Between Class And Interface? -->

<!-- 
In object-oriented programming, both classes and interfaces are important concepts, but they serve different purposes:

Class:
-----
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.
It can contain member variables, methods, constructors, destructors, etc.
Classes can be instantiated to create objects, which are instances of the class.
Classes can provide concrete implementations of methods.

Interface:
---------
An interface is a contract specifying a set of methods that a class must implement if it implements that interface.
It contains only method signatures (declarations) without any method bodies (implementations).
Interfaces are used to define a protocol or behavior that classes can adhere to, without specifying how they should implement it.
A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to provide different behaviors as required.
Interfaces facilitate code reusability and promote loose coupling between classes.
