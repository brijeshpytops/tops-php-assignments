<!-- What is the difference between prop and attr? -->

Both prop() and attr() are methods used to get or set properties or attributes of DOM elements, but they serve different purposes and behave differently in certain situations:

prop():

The prop() method is primarily used to get or set properties of DOM elements, such as checked, disabled, selected, etc.

It is recommended for changing properties that represent the current state of an element, such as checked or selected status of checkboxes or radio buttons.

It returns the current value of the specified property for the first element in the set of matched elements, or sets one or more properties for every matched element.

It works well with boolean properties, as it returns a boolean value representing the current state of the property.

Example : 

<script>
    // Get the checked status of a checkbox
    var isChecked = $('#checkbox').prop('checked');

    // Set the checked status of a checkbox
    $('#checkbox').prop('checked', true);

</script>

attr():

The attr() method is primarily used to get or set attributes of DOM elements, such as src, href, title, etc.

It is recommended for changing attributes that represent static values, such as URLs or titles.

It returns the value of the attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements, or sets one or more attributes for every matched element.

It works well with attributes that have string values.

Example :
<script>
    // Get the href attribute of a link
    var hrefValue = $('a').attr('href');

    // Set the href attribute of a link
    $('a').attr('href', 'https://example.com');

</script>
