<!-- Document Load Vs Window. Load() jQuery -->

$(document).ready():

- This method is used to execute code once the DOM (Document Object Model) is fully loaded.

- It ensures that the code inside the function passed to $(document).ready() is executed as soon as the DOM hierarchy is constructed and ready for manipulation.

- It does not wait for external resources like images to be fully loaded; it only waits for the HTML structure to be parsed.

Example :
 <script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
    // Code to be executed when the DOM is ready
    });
 </script>


$(window).load():

- This method is used to execute code once the entire window, including all assets like images and iframes, has finished loading.

- It waits for all resources referenced by the HTML document to be loaded, including images, CSS, and scripts.

- It can be useful when you need to manipulate elements or perform actions that depend on the dimensions of images or other assets.

Example :

<script>
    $(window).load(function() {
        // Code to be executed when the entire window is fully loaded
    });

</script>
