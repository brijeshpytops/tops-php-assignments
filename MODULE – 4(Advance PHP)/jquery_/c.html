<!-- Which is the starting point of code execution in jQuery? -->

The starting point of code execution typically occurs when the document is fully loaded and ready to be manipulated. This is often achieved using the $(document).ready() function, which is a jQuery method that allows you to specify a function to execute once the DOM is fully loaded.

<script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
        // Code of block
    });

    // shorthand notation 
    $(function() { 
        /* code */ 
    });
</script>
