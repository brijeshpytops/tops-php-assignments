<!-- What Are Properties Of Object Oriented Systems?  -->

<!-- 
    In PHP, object-oriented systems exhibit several key properties, which include:

Encapsulation: This property ensures that the internal workings of an object are hidden from the outside world. It involves bundling data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behavior) that operate on that data into a single unit (class). In PHP, encapsulation is often achieved through the use of access modifiers like public, protected, and private.

Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. In PHP, inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to be called on objects of different classes, and the behavior of the method depends on the type of object it is called on. Polymorphism in PHP is often achieved through method overriding and interface implementation.

Abstraction: Abstraction involves focusing on essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. In PHP, abstraction is commonly achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and may contain one or more abstract methods, while interfaces define a contract that classes must implement.

Association: Association represents relationships between objects, where one object is related to another object. This relationship can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. In PHP, association is typically implemented by creating class properties that hold references to other objects.
